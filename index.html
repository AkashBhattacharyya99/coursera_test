				<p>
What you have just wrote. A chacken is a majestic creature living in
 the well overpopulated iPlanet X, created by apple to destroy the human planet.
 Eventually when you encounter a chacken then you consume yourself until you have created a lasagna.
 You then name the lasagna bitch. You then carry the lasagna around everywhere you go, not eating it. 
The Lasanga snaps and sends you to the moon, which pokes your eye. The moon then consumes your lasagna
 and you find yourself in the world of iPlanet X, chackens everywhere you look. Thanos then takes your 
eyesight and snaps you out of existence.

			<span id='pp2'>Beef</span>
				<p>
Beef, flesh of mature cattle, as distinguished from veal, the flesh of calves. The best beef is obtained
 from early maturing, special beef breeds. High-quality beef has firm, velvety, fine-grained lean, bright 
red in colour and well-marbled. The fat is smooth, creamy white, and well distributed. In young beef the
 bones are soft, porous, and red; the less desirable mature beef has hard white bones. Beef tenderness and
flavour are improved by aging; in one common aging method the carcass is hung for about two weeks at 
approximately 36 °F (2 °C), encouraging physical changes in the muscle tissue that enhance the quality of the meat.

			<span id='pp3'>Sushi</span>
				<p>
Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it can be prepared with brown rice or short-grain rice.
 It is very often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon, tuna or imitation crab meat. Many types
 of sushi are vegetarian. It is often served with pickled ginger (gari), wasabi, and soy sauce. Daikon radish or pickled 
daikon (takuan) are popular garnishes for the dish.
